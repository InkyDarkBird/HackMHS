## Inspiration
We were inspired by the lack of economic education and the difficulty of economic math.

## What it does
Our calculator can calculate multiple functions related to economics, such as modeling interest rates and calculating break-even points. It can also save money values from previous sessions. Because it is built of a mainly python framework, it can be imported to other things, such as a discord bot, very easily.

## How we built it
We coded the program with Python using Live Share inside VSCode. We shared code versions with each other using Github.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges like saving and loading information and making the libraries work.

## What we learned
We learned how to use the matplotlib library and the csv library in Python.

## What's next for Economic Calculator
Improvement can be made on user interface and the amount of functions.
